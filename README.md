Last year I had made a periodic table trainer for myself and other chemistry students to memorize certain elements. It ran on an ide, and the user would interact and answer its questions through the input box on the
ide. This year, the new chemistry students were asking for a link to the old project. I had been hosting it on repl.it, but due to payment changes and a limit on the amount of collaborators, the repl.it project was
deleted. I tried to find another suitable ide, but none would allow me to share the project via a link to others. The project was anyway quite cumbersome for the average user, so I decided to make with the gpt-5 an
actual website with GUI for the game, hosted on github pages. Here is the link: https://fractalgeometrymathematician.github.io/periodic-trainer/
